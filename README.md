# HDRUK Reinforcement Learning Spring Project

## Project Overview

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a dynamic learning paradigm in which an "agent" interacts with the environment by performing "actions" according to a "policy". The policy is optimised (learning) in order to maximise the expected reward received from the environment. As a consequence, reinforcement learning can cater to certain complexities, often involving time-varying components, in health problems that cannot be formulated using static modelling approaches (e.g. classification tasks). Recently, the developments in "deep reinforcement learning" have been transformational by leveraging the utility of deep neural networks to overcome limiting parametric assumptions and provide efficient optimisation based frameworks for learning.

The aim of this project is to provide a focused period to learn about RL to arm yourself with a new skill that might be beneficial for your future research. We will do this by developing a trajectory model for multimorbidity by constructing a multi-state model, with a large state space, through a reinforcement learning approach. 

Multimorbidity refers to the conditions of individuals having multiple disease conditions at the same time. A major research question is to understand the sequences that conditions are acquired in and whether there are distinct patterns underlying those disease patterns. In order to do this we require a time-varying model of disease acquisition. However, as there are 100s of conditions, and patient databases can contain millions of individuals with 10s of millions of electronic records, the potential models could be vast.

Aims:

1. To develop an understanding of reinforcement learning and the various learning paradigms (e.g. actor-critic, Q-learning) and the deep RL extensions.

2. To understand the problem of multimorbidity trajectory modelling and the utility of multi-state models.

3. To develop and implement a RL-based approach for learning multi-state models.

If time allows, application to real world datasets will be undertaken but this is principally a methodological learning and development project. You will therefore be guided to develop skills in generating suitable artificial but real-world inspired data sets for model development.
